# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.4.15


Pros:
- This project to learn the important concepts in VR implementation.

Cons:
- The videos need an update according to new versions in SteamVR, because it took from me alot of time to understand it.

Challenges:
1. Understanding new version of SteamVR and update its code in order to meet the project requirements (such as, updating SteamVR teleport code to make it just for left hand).
2. Doing the Menu using Radial Menu ( I developed the menu that is explained in the videos and it is running, but I liked to make something different and implement a Radial menu and that took two weeks).
3. Implementing a method to allow a player to delete a tool that they chose it from the menu.
4. Instead of designing an UI to explain the instruction of the game, I implemented hints that are displayed on controller to show the player how to play (only this it took 8 days to understand and implement it).

Used System: 
Windows Mixed Reality, and SteamVR 2.2.

Note: 
I attached a Word file "Input for OpenVR controllers". which I did it to make sure that the buttons that I chose will run on all VR systems brands. These buttons for open/close Menu, and delete a tool that is chosen from the Menu.
